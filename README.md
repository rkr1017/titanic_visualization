Summary

This is an exerpt from Kaggle website.
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. 
One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
The goal this visualization is to illustrate the differences between chances of survival for different groups of people based on sex, age and class.

Design

Bar chart was chosen to represent survival rates of groups of people because it is very good in displaing relative numbers/proportions of multiple categories. Color was used as a visual encoding to such categories as passenger sex and class. Ages were binned in 10-year intervals. Two charts in the upper row show average survival rates for different age groups and classes. Below in a secod row charts show total number of passengers in each category for comparison. Sometimes very few passengers are in the given category which helps to interpret the outliers in the survival rates charts.
